## Version Control System (VCS)

- Also known as **Source Code Management (SCM)**.

- It is an important and powerful software tool that serves to keep track of and manage changes to files over time.

- A VCS is similar to a *save* or *checkpoint* system in video games, where users can *take snapshots* of the state of files in a project folder at certain points in time; these changes are stored in a special kind of database.

- This will allow users to access earlier versions of file(s), compare changes, and/or reverse/undo the changes in case something goes wrong.

- VCS also allows users to create *'separate timelines'* (branches) of certain states, and may merge these separate branches later on if needed.

- Using VCS is essential for tracking projects with collaborative workflows involving multiple contributors.


### Types of Version Control Systems (VCS)
1. **Centralized VCS**
   - There is a single copy of the project and its history that is stored on a central server.

   - Each user needs to be online to access and interact with the central server with their local machines to work on the project.

   - Examples of *centralized VCS* are [Concurrent Versions System (CVS)](https://cvs.nongnu.org/), [Subversion(SVN)](https://subversion.apache.org/) and [Perforce](https://www.perforce.com/).


2. **Distributed VCS**
   - Each user has a copy of the entire project and its history in their respective local machines.

   - Each user can work on the project even when offline.

   - Examples of *distributed VCS* are [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/).
