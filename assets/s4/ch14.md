- User creates/edits/codes files in the workspace (using a code editor, IDE, word processor, etc.) and saves the files inside the repo once done.

- `Git` will detect changes in the files:
  - Newly-created files will be designated as *untracked files*.
  - Existing files that had their contents changed will be designated as *modified files*.

- User groups together files with common changes and *adds* them to the *staging area*.
- After user has finished adding and reviewing the files in the *staging area*, the user *commits* the changes into `Git`. Upon *committing*, `Git` takes a *"snapshot"* of the changes made to the files at the time of that particular *commit* and saves it into the `Git` repository history. This is usually the default or *main* branch.
- Workflow process repeats until entire project is finished. By the time the project is finished, `Git` will have a collection of all the changes and history of *commits* that were made during the entire project development process.
