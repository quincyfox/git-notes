- *Committing* is the process of finalizing the changed files from the *staging area*, and creating a *snapshot* of these changes.

- This is accomplished through the `git commit` command.

- When using `git commit`, it is required to include a *commit message*, which is a brief summary (usually a single sentence or a short phrase) describing the change that was implemented in the project or files at that point in time. To include a commit message, we use the `-m` (for *message*) option:
```shell
$ git commit -m "add new row to the user information table"
```

- The commit message must be enclosed in quotes and ideally should be using an *imperative verb form* (not past or future tense). A good way to ensure that your commit message will follow this grammar structure is by imagining yourself talking to someone and starting with the phrase: *"If implemented, my commit will..."*, then finish the rest of the sentence with your commit message.

- If you type only `git commit` without the `-m` option, `Git` will open its default text editor and require you to enter a commit message before proceeding. If you followed the instructions earlier back in [Section 2](../s2/ch04.md), then VS Code will open, otherwise, it will be *Vim!* Good luck exiting that! (Hint: :q).
