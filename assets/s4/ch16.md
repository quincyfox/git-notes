- *Committing* is the process of finalizing the changed files from the *staging area*, and creating a *snapshot* of these changes.

- This is accomplished through the `git commit` command:
```shell
$ git commit -m "<commit message>"
# The -m flag stands for "message"
# The commit message must be enclosed in quotes
# Example: git commit -m "add new row to table"
```

- A *commit message* is a brief summary (usually a single sentence or a short phrase) describing the change that was implemented in the project or files at that point in time.

- Best practice for writing commit messages:
  - As much as possible, a commit message should include and describe only a single change at a time (ex: add a feature, revise a line, fix a bug, etc.). This will ensure that in case a commit needs to be undone or rolled back later on, only one change will be affected.
  - The commit message ideally should be using an *imperative verb form* (not past or future tense). A good way to ensure that your commit message will follow this grammar structure is by imagining yourself talking to `Git` and giving it an order: *"Hey Git, I want you to... "*, then finish the rest of the sentence with your commit message.

- If you type only `git commit` at the Terminal without the `-m` flag, `Git` will open its default text editor and require you to enter a commit message before proceeding. If you followed the instructions back in [Section 2](../s2/ch04.md), then VS Code will open, otherwise; it will be *Vim!* Good luck exiting that! (Hint: :q).
