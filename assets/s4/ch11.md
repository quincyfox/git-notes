## The Git Repository

- A repository, or *repo* for short, is just a folder where your project files are stored.
- This is a special folder that's been *initialized* using `Git`. ANY files or folders / subfolders that you will create or put inside this repository will be tracked by `Git` for changes, but it is possible to have `Git` **ignore** any files or folders in the repository that you don't want to get tracked (more on this later).
- When a folder is converted, or *initialized*, into a `Git` repository, `Git` will create a hidden folder (`.git/`) inside of that folder, where the `Git` files are stored.
- It is possible to have more than one repository in a user's computer, but a `Git` repository should never be put inside another `Git` repository!
- Each project that you build should be in its own *separate* repository. Don't use one common repository for several projects!
