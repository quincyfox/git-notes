## The Git Repository

- A repository, or *repo* for short, is just a folder where your project files are stored.
- This is a special folder that's been *initialized* using `Git`. Any files or folders that you will create or put inside this repository will be tracked by `Git` for changes.
- When a folder is converted, or *initialized*, into a `Git` repository, `Git` will create a hidden folder (`.git/`) inside of that folder, where the `Git` files are stored.
- It is possible to have more than one repository in a user's computer, but a `Git` repository should never be put inside another `Git` repository!
