## Git Installation: Requirements

- Basic familiarity in navigating the terminal, because `Git` per se makes use of the Linux Bash (Bourne-Again Shell) command-line interface (CLI).

- As an alternative, there are now Graphical User Inteface (GUI) Clients available for`Git`; among the more popular ones are [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/), and [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/). However, GUI clients, while having better visuals and user interfaces, are somewhat limited in their capabilities compared to the `Git` command line. Use of the `Git` GUI clients are not covered in these notes.

- Even though using `Git` via the CLI has a higher learning curve, it is recommended to know at least the basic operational commands in order to be able to use `Git` on ANY type of computer, whether terminal or GUI-based.

- `Git` can be installed and set up on computers with different types of Operating Systems.
