## Bash Basics: Introduction

- To be proficient in using `Git`, we need some familiarity with the **Bash** terminal.

- **Bash** is a UNIX-based terminal that's been used in Linux and Mac-based systems.

- `Git` was built to work on **Bash**.

- For Linux and MacOS systems, just launch the Terminal, and you're ready to work with `Git`.

- For Windows-based systems, there are two recommended options for working with `Git`:

  - The `Git Bash` terminal application that comes bundled with `Git for Windows` (although it is possible to run `Git` on Command Prompt / Terminal / PowerShell once you have installed `Git for Windows` and configured the PATH/environment variables, it is better to use `Git Bash` for maximum compatibility).

  - Install [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) and you can use an actual Linux Bash terminal in Windows to run `Git`.

- A typical **Bash** terminal is denoted by a `$` symbol at the prompt.
