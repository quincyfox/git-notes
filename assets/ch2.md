### What is Git?
- `Git` is a free, fast, and open-source **Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)**.
- It is the most widely-used version control system in the world today.
- `Git` was created by [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) (who also happens to be the creator of the Linux kernel, but that is for another story!) in 2005, after [BitKeeper](https://www.bitkeeper.org/), the VCS he initially used for Linux development, revoked its free license. As he wasn't able to find a suitable replacement (and being the legend that he is), Torvalds decided to take matters into his own hands and ended up developing his own version control system!
- `Git` allows tracking of changes made across different files, comparing project versions, accessing earlier versions of files *("time traveling")*, and also facilitates collaboration between multiple developers, wherein they can share changes made with each other, and finally combine those changes and resolve any conflicts that may arise until the project is finalized.
