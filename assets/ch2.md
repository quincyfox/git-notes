### What is Git?
- `Git` is a free, fast, and open-source **Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)**.

- It is the most widely-used version control system in the world today.

- The latest version of Git is v.2.43.

- `Git` was created by [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) (who also happens to be the creator of the Linux kernel, but that is for another story!) in 2005, after [BitKeeper](https://www.bitkeeper.org/), the VCS he initially used for Linux development, revoked its free license. As he wasn't able to find a suitable replacement (and being the legend that he is), Torvalds decided to take matters into his own hands and ended up developing his own version control system!

- It is currently maintained by a team of software engineers led by Google engineer [Junio Hamano](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junio_Hamano), to whom Torvalds turned the entire Git project over.

- `Git` allows tracking of changes made across different files, comparing project versions, accessing earlier versions of files *("time traveling")*, and also facilitates collaboration between multiple developers, wherein they can share changes made with each other, and finally combine those changes and resolve any conflicts that may arise until the project is finalized.


### ... So Why is It Called 'Git'?

- According to the [README.md](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/README.md) file of the Git source code repository:

> <i>The name "git" was given by Linus Torvalds when he wrote the very first version. He described the tool as "the stupid content tracker" and the name as (depending on your mood):
>
> - random three-letter combination that is pronounceable, and not actually used by any common UNIX command. The fact that it is a mispronunciation of "get" may or may not be relevant.
>
> - stupid. contemptible and despicable. simple. Take your pick from the dictionary of slang.
>
> - "global information tracker": you're in a good mood, and it actually works for you. Angels sing, and a light suddenly fills the room.
> 
> - "goddamn idiotic truckload of sh*t": when it breaks</i>


### Uses of Git

Git (with or without GitHub) has proven useful for tracking and managing single or collaborative work in the following areas:

- Small to large-scale software development projects.

- UI/UX and other design-oriented projects.

- Drafting of laws and other official documents by government agencies.

- Datasets and codebases used in scientific or academic research.

- Literature work, such as books, novels, screenplays, and others.

- Musical work by composers/musicians.


### Git vs. GitHub

- `Git` and `GitHub` are not the same.

- `Git`, as defined earlier, is a type of version control software system.

- `GitHub` is one of several online hosting (*cloud*) service / website for Git repositories, where you can upload (*push*) your local project repository, if needed (though not required).

- `Git` is not dependent on `GitHub` and can be used without the latter.

- `GitHub` nor an Internet connection is not a prerequisite for using `Git`; you can continue using `Git` on your computer even when you are offline and don't have access to the Internet.
